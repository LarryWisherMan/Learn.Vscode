# Exercise 1: Get Familiar with the VS Code Interface

This exercise introduces you to the core components of Visual Studio Code's interface. Each of these components plays a role in your daily scripting and development workflow.

## Objective
Understand the layout and function of the VS Code interface, focusing on areas that support PowerShell and Git usage.

---

## Activity Bar

The Activity Bar is located on the **left-hand side** of the window. It provides access to major features and views.

1. Locate the **Activity Bar**.
2. Click on the following icons and observe what each one does:
   - **Explorer**: Displays the file and folder structure.
   - **Search**: Allows you to search across files in the workspace.
   - **Source Control**: Shows Git repository status, staged/unstaged changes, and history.
   - **Extensions**: Lets you install, manage, and explore extensions.
   - **Run and Debug** (if visible): Allows launching and debugging scripts.

---

## Editor Area

The Editor Area is where you open and edit files.

- Click on a file in the **Explorer** to open it in the editor.
- Tabs across the top show which files are currently open.
- You can have multiple editor groups (more on that later).

---

## Panel

The Panel is at the bottom of the window.

- This area contains the **Terminal**, **Problems**, **Output**, and **Debug Console** tabs.
- For now, we will focus only on the **Terminal**.

---

## Status Bar

The Status Bar is at the **bottom of the window** and shows useful context such as:

- The current Git branch
- Line/column number
- File type (PowerShell, Markdown, etc.)
- Extension activity

## Exercise Steps

1. Open VS Code and locate the Activity Bar, Editor Area, Panel, and Status Bar.
2. Click through each Activity Bar icon and explore their contents.
3. Hover over elements in the Status Bar to see what they display.
4. Optional: Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the **Command Palette**, then type and select `Toggle Terminal` to open the terminal panel.

## Discussion

We will walk through each component as a group. Youâ€™ll be using these areas every time you work with PowerShell in VS Code, so becoming familiar with them now will help with everything that follows.
