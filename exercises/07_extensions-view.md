# Exercise 7: Explore the Extensions View

Visual Studio Code supports a wide range of extensions to enhance your scripting and development experience. This exercise introduces the Extensions View and confirms the PowerShell extension is installed and active.

---

## Objective

- Locate and use the Extensions View in VS Code
- Confirm that the **PowerShell extension** is installed
- Understand the role of extensions in enhancing editor functionality

---

## Steps

1. Open the **Extensions View**:
   - Click on the square icon on the **Activity Bar** (usually the last icon)
   - Or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`

2. In the **search bar**, type:

```text
PowerShell
```

1. Verify the **PowerShell extension by Microsoft** is installed.

- It should appear first in the list.
- If installed, you will see "Uninstall" and "Disable" buttons (do not uninstall).
- If it is not installed (unlikely), click **Install**.

2. Click on the extension to view its full details.

- Read the description and note key features:
  - Syntax highlighting
  - IntelliSense
  - Script execution and debugging support
  - Integrated terminal support

3. (Optional) Browse other recommended extensions:

- Search for: `Markdown All in One`, `GitLens`, or `PSScriptAnalyzer`

## Discussion

Extensions are a key part of working efficiently in VS Code. The PowerShell extension provides deep integration for scripting workflows. Future sessions will assume this extension is available and active.

You do **not** need to install or configure anything manually during this sessionâ€”this step is only to help you become familiar with where these tools live and how to verify they are working.
