# Exercise 9: Work with Workspaces

Visual Studio Code allows you to manage multiple folders and projects within a single window by using a workspace. This exercise will show you how to open a folder, add additional folders, and save the configuration as a `.code-workspace` file.

---

## Objective

- Understand what a **VS Code workspace** is
- Learn how to **add multiple folders** to a workspace
- Learn how to **save and reopen** a workspace for future use

---

## Steps

### 1. Open the Exercises Folder

- From the menu bar, select:
```
File > Open Folder...
```
- Choose your cloned exercises folder.

---

### 2. Add Another Folder to the Workspace

- From the menu bar, select:
```
File > Add Folder to Workspace...
```
- Select another folder on your system (e.g., `Documents\PowerShell`, or create a placeholder folder).
- You will now see **both folders** listed in the Explorer view.

---

### 3. Save the Workspace

- From the menu bar, select:
```
File > Save Workspace As...
```
- Save the file with a name like `DevOpsTraining.code-workspace`.

---

### 4. Reopen a Workspace Later

- Double-click the saved `.code-workspace` file
- VS Code will open with the same folder structure and layout as before

---

## Discussion

Workspaces are helpful when:
- You regularly work with scripts from multiple directories
- You want to group automation tools and documentation together
- You want to preserve your layout and open folders between sessions

> This is optional for Phase 0 but becomes useful in structured tool development or when switching between multiple environments.
