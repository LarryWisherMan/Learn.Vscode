# Reference: Cloning the Training Repository

Before starting the session, you should have cloned the repository containing the Phase 0 training exercises.

If needed, here are two ways to do this:

---

## Option 1: Clone Using Visual Studio Code

1. Open **VS Code**
2. Open the Command Palette: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
3. Search for and select `Git: Clone`
4. Paste the repository URL (provided by your instructor)
5. Choose a destination folder on your machine
6. After cloning, select **"Open"** to load the folder in VS Code

---

## Option 2: Clone Using the Terminal

If you prefer using Git in the terminal:

```powershell
git clone
```

Then open the folder in VS Code:

```powershell
code vscode-training
```

Once the repository is open in VS Code, navigate to the `exercises/` folder to begin.
