# Phase 0 â€“ DevOps Literacy Orientation: VS Code Exercises

Welcome to the Phase 0 orientation exercises. These exercises are designed to introduce you to Visual Studio Code and its role in supporting PowerShell scripting, version control, and DevOps workflows.

---

## Purpose

This session is part of our team's transition from traditional GUI-based system administration (clickOps) to a modern, PowerShell-first DevOps approach.

You will gain hands-on experience using Visual Studio Code as a tool for:

- Navigating and editing scripts
- Running code using the integrated terminal
- Exploring Git integration
- Customizing your development environment

---

## Prerequisites

Before beginning these exercises, you should have already:

- Installed **Visual Studio Code** (provided via Software Center)
- Configured your Git identity using `git config`
- Cloned the training repository to your local machine

---

## How to Use

1. Open the cloned repository folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Navigate to the `exercises/` folder in the Explorer pane.
3. Complete the exercises in order, unless otherwise instructed during the session.
4. All exercises are self-contained and include instructions in either `.md` or `.ps1` format.
